# Contributing to blip

Thanks for looking. This file is short on ceremony and specific about the things
that will otherwise waste your afternoon.

blip is early. The reader and the machine run real programs, tail calls are
real, and the six programs in `examples/` are the specification the interpreter
is written against. Three documented things do not work yet, and they are named
in the README, in `tests/tail_calls.v`, and in `docs/010-roadmap.md` rather than
quietly missing.

## Branches

```
main   stable. Only releases come from here. Protected: no direct pushes.
dev      integration. Where pull requests land.
<topic>  a branch off dev, named after what it does
```

- Branch off `dev`, not `main`.
- Open the pull request against `dev`.
- `dev` is merged into `main` when a milestone's gate is met, and that merge is
  what a release is cut from.
- A release is a tag on `main` (`v0.2.0`), pushed deliberately. `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  builds and verifies on the tag; a manual run of that workflow builds and
  verifies but never publishes, so a dry run cannot create a release by accident.

Why two long-lived branches rather than one: `main` is what someone can depend
on, so it has to move only when something is genuinely finished. With one branch,
every half-finished interpreter is the thing people install.

## Build and test

Requires V 0.5.2, specifically **vlang/v main at the commit pinned in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**. That is not pedantry — the `0.5.2` release build
resolves `vlib.blip.*` against V's own standard library and reports every module
in this repository as an unknown function, for files that exist and compile
locally. See section 7.1a of `docs/010-roadmap.md`.

On Linux, `v` defaults to its experimental V3 compiler and silently falls back
to the established one, which resolves modules differently again. If you get a
wall of `unknown function` errors on files that build fine, set this first:

```sh
export V_MACOS_V3_NO_FALLBACK=1
```

Always pass `-cc gcc`. The default C backend fails on this checkout, and CI uses
the same flag so the two cannot drift apart.

```sh
v -cc gcc -o blip.exe blip.v                  # the CLI
.\blip.exe examples\01_basics.lip

v -cc gcc -o tools\tail.exe tests\tail_calls.v && .\tools\tail.exe
v -cc gcc -o tools\nt.exe   tests\non_tail.v   && .\tools\nt.exe
v -cc gcc -o tools\lf.exe   tests\loop_forms.v && .\tools\lf.exe

v -cc gcc -o reader_probe.exe reader_probe.v
.\reader_probe.exe examples\*.lip
```

All seventeen suites must print no `FAIL` line and the reader probe must report zero
diagnostics. The runners do not set a non-zero exit code yet, which is why CI
greps for `FAIL`.

The seventeen are: `tail_calls`, `non_tail`, `loop_forms`, `binding_forms`,
`embedding`, `repl_golden`, `examples_run`, `programs_run`, `genprims`,
`unit`, `emit_js`, `lsp`, `hostile`, `multi_use`, `value_to_datum`,
`macros_gate`. (`CONTRIBUTING.md` said nine, then eleven, then twelve for
a while after the rest were already in CI, which is the kind of drift this
line exists to stop. The live list is the one in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
— if the two disagree, `ci.yml` wins.)

### The C-stage flake: `src.c:...: unterminated #ifndef`

A build occasionally dies with

```
C compiler output from the default V compiler:
src.c:1280: error: unterminated #ifndef
  1280 | #ifndef RAND_MAX
V compilation failed (c_compilation_error); retrying with a fallback
compiler ...
```

This is **not** a bug in blip's source, and the fallback errors that follow are
noise — the fallback mis-reads the same code. Re-run the build: it succeeds
without any change. It was observed five times in one session, twice in a row
from the same command, and 0 times in six consecutive runs afterwards.

What is known: it happens in the C stage, before the fallback, and the same
command always succeeds on a re-run. What is not known: the trigger. It is
recorded here rather than chased, because a flake that cannot be reproduced on
demand cannot be fixed, only worked around, and a workaround for an unknown
trigger is a guess. If it ever reproduces reliably, that is the time to read the
generated `src.c` around the reported line.

## Adding to the interpreter

- **Test first, in the shape that would have caught the bug.** `tests/non_tail.v`
  exists because every tail-call test passed while `(fib 20)` returned `-360`.
  The regression cases are the ones that separate your bug from the plausible
  alternatives; write those.
- **A comment earns its place by explaining a non-obvious choice.** Several in
  `machine/mod.v` explain why the obvious version is wrong, because I wrote the
  obvious version first and it was wrong. Do the same.
- **Do not paper over a V quirk without saying so.** The index loops and the
  `NodeId` workarounds are load-bearing and platform-dependent. If you remove one
  because the compiler was fixed, remove its comment in the same commit.

## The website

The site is generated. Do not edit anything in `site_out/` — it is rebuilt
by `site/build.lip` on every pages deploy.

```sh
v -cc gcc -o blip.exe blip.v
.\blip.exe run site\build.lip
```

- Page structure lives in `site/build.lip`, as blip code.
- All user-visible text lives in `site/content/*.md`, one file per route.
- The shared template is `site/layout.html` (`{{title}}`/`{{body}}`
  placeholders, filled with `string-replace`).

## Reporting a bug

Include the V version (`v version` — the build hash matters), the platform, the
smallest program that shows it, and what you expected. A non-tail recursion bug
report is worth much more with the `(fib 20)` result and the continuation depth
at the end.
