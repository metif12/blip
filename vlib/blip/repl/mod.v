module repl

// The REPL: one persistent machine, reading through a Host.
//
// It lives in the library rather than in blip.v for one reason -- every behaviour
// worth testing here needs a Host, and without the interface that means a
// subprocess and a scraped stdout. With it, the whole REPL can be driven from a
// test by handing it lines and reading back what it printed.
//
// Four properties this has, each of which was a bug or a missing feature first:
//
//   * One machine for the session. Definitions accumulate, which is the entire
//     point: a REPL that starts a fresh machine per line cannot define anything.
//   * Multi-line input. A form that is not finished yet is INCOMPLETE, not
//     broken, and the session keeps reading. The reader reports the two
//     separately for exactly this.
//   * Error recovery. A bad form prints one line and the session continues. This
//     is only possible because no failure panics; see the errors-are-values work
//     in machine/mod.v.
//   * `,l` loads a file into the RUNNING machine, so a definition made in the
//     REPL is still there afterwards and one made in the file is there before.
