module host

// Host is everything blip needs from the world outside itself.
//
// It exists because "print to stdout" is the one thing that stops an interpreter
// being embeddable. A host that wants the program's output has no way to take it,
// so the interpreter prints and the host never sees it; the obvious workaround --
// the embedder shells out and scrapes -- throws away every other reason to embed:
// the machine's state, its limits, and its step count.
//
// Two rules for implementations:
//
//  1. Nothing here may panic. A host method that fails turns into a returned
//     error, because the whole point of the interface is that a bad program is a
//     value rather than a dead process.
//  2. `host_load` returns SOURCE. It does not evaluate. The machine evaluates it,
//     in itself, so definitions cross the file boundary. A host that ran the
//     file would create a second machine and nothing the file defined would be
//     visible -- which is the bug this shape exists to prevent.
//
// The four methods are the ones the roadmap lists. Resist adding more: each one is
// a capability every embedder has to implement, and a fifth method would turn a
// two-method toy into an interface nobody wants to satisfy.

// The rules and the reason they exist are above; this file only needs os.

// CaptureHost collects output instead of writing it, and answers reads and loads
// from lists supplied by the test. This is the type that makes a golden test
// possible without spawning a process, and it is the reason the interface is
// four methods rather than one.
//
// The mutable state below is behind a pointer and every write to it is inside an
// `unsafe` block. That is forced by V, not chosen. A V interface method has an
// IMMUTABLE receiver -- the checker offers `(mut h &CaptureHost)` and there is no
// `(mut &T)` receiver -- and an immutable receiver cannot assign into a map it
// holds either: "field state of struct &CaptureHost is immutable", with no
// method-call spelling available because `map.set` is private in this V version.
//
// The alternative was rejected: a stateless CaptureHost, with the golden test
// spawning a real process and scraping its stdout. That makes every REPL check
// cost a process spawn, and the REPL is where all the interesting behaviour is.
