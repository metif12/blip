module main

// The multi-source gate (roadmap P1: "many sources, one machine").
//
// Definitions must cross a run_str boundary on the ONE machine: the second
// source sees what the first defined, and a definition made between the two
// is visible to the second. A machine that started fresh per load breaks
// both halves. Cross-file `use` (loading a FILE into the running machine)
// is a separate property, covered by tests/embedding.v's load checks.
