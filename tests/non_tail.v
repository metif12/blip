/* Non-tail calls, and the environment bug that hid inside one.
 *
 * `Kont` once had no environment field, so after a call returned, the machine
 * kept evaluating the remaining arguments in the CALLEE's frame. Every tail-call
 * test passed anyway, because a tail call never returns to a frame that still
 * has an argument left to evaluate. The tell was that one nested call per
 * operator position was fine and two were not:
 *
 *   (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))
 *
 * evaluated (- n 2) with n taken from fib's own frame, so (fib 2) was 0 and
 * (fib 10) was 55 - off by a sign on the subtraction. These cases exist so that
 * regression cannot come back unnoticed.
