/* The M3 gate: proper tail calls.
 *
 * These are the properties the whole design rests on. Applying a closure must
 * NOT push a continuation frame, so a tail call -- including MUTUAL recursion --
 * is a loop iteration rather than a stack mutation. Steel needs a separate
 * TCOJMP opcode for this and still ships SELFTAILCALLNOARITY.
 *
 * Every depth here is large enough that a machine without real TCO would either
 * overflow or grow its continuation stack visibly.
