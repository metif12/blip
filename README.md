A Lisp dialect implemented in V, designed so that ordinary programs are written
**without macros** — while macros remain available for the cases that genuinely
need them.

S-expressions and a Racket-shaped surface, plus three things modern Lisps have
each solved separately and no single language has combined:

- **`match*`** — atomic multi-subject pattern matching (from Racket). Match two
  values at once without nesting one `match` inside another.
- **`use`** — callback capture that keeps chains flat instead of staircasing the
  indentation (from Gleam).
- **Opaque types** — encapsulation by export metadata, with no class system, no
  interfaces, and no multiple inheritance (from Gleam).

Execution is a CEK-style machine with an explicit heap stack, which gives proper
tail calls today and fibers later with no redesign.

There is no static type system in v1. Type information exists as optional, erased
annotations plus runtime contracts, and both are opt-in per program.

## Status

Milestone **M3** — the CEK machine runs real programs with real tail calls.
The reader parses all six example programs; the machine evaluates closures,
arithmetic, branching, `loop`, `dotimes`, `letrec`, `cond` and `case`.

Past M3 and working: a REPL with golden tests, errors as values with
source-context frames, real programs in `programs/` (brainfuck, json), a
browser playground (`site/playground.html` served by `server.v`), and
machine-generated prims (`tools/genprims.vsh`, `math-*` pilot). Recent
changes are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.

| `docs/000-blip-design.md` | the design document: motivation, language, architecture, trade-offs, comparisons |
| `docs/010-roadmap.md` | embedding, the REPL, the example programs to write, and the veb final phase |
| `vlib/blip/` | the implementation: value representation, reader, printer, machine, primitives |
| `examples/` | the six programs that define the syntax; all parse |
| `tests/tail_calls.v` | tail-call and derived-form suite (21 passing) |
| `tests/non_tail.v` | non-tail sibling calls, the case the environment bug hid in |
| `tests/loop_forms.v` | `loop`, `dotimes` and `letrec` |
| `tests/binding_forms.v` | `let`, `let*`, `letrec`, rest parameters, shadowing, no leaking |
| `tests/embedding.v` | the machine as a value: independent machines, limits, surviving bad programs |
| `tests/repl_golden.v` | the REPL in-process plus a stdin-to-stdout golden fixture |
| `tests/examples_run.v` | all six examples run to their markers |
| `tests/programs_run.v` | brainfuck and json run to their markers |
| `tests/genprims.v` | every generated prim's value, arity, and type errors |
| `tests/multi_use.v` | `use` loads into the one running machine: definitions cross the boundary |
| `tests/value_to_datum.v` | `value_to_datum`: values convert back to AST nodes (the macro path's inverse direction) |
| `tests/macros_gate.v` | the embedded-machine macro path: pure shapes convert end-to-end, complex shapes refuse by error |

`let*`, rest parameters and callable keywords now work, and `tests/binding_forms.v`
covers them. The three were long misdiagnosed as one problem — "`[...]` is a vector
literal in a value position and a binding group in a form position" — and were
actually two unrelated parser bugs: `let*` started its recursion at binding 1 and
so silently dropped the first binding, and `.` was parsed as an ordinary parameter
named `.`. `[...]` is resolved by position, not by a reader flag: in the second
slot of `let`/`let*`/`letrec` it is a binding group, and everywhere else it is a
vector literal. Both `[a 1]` and `(a 1)` are accepted as a binding, because the
examples and the documentation disagree about which to write and the examples win.

### Verified

```text
ok   self tail call 250k => 250000   (steps=7000020, kont=0)
ok   mutual tail call 2e4 => pong   (steps=400020,  kont=0)
ok   tail in cond 1e5 => 100000     (steps=2900021,  kont=0)
ok   non-tail fib => 6765           (steps=503488,   kont=0)
ok   loop => 7                      (steps=185,      kont=0)
```

A stack depth of `0` at the end of a quarter-million tail calls is the whole point: the
frame in tail position is reused rather than pushed.

## Install

Requires V 0.5.2 (the v3-line compiler). Use `-cc gcc`: the default C backend
fails on this checkout, and CI uses the same flag.

### macOS & Linux

```sh
curl -fsSL https://metif12.github.io/blip/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

```powershell
irm https://metif12.github.io/blip/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Docker

Three toolchains, each building the pinned V compiler from source, in
`docker/`. CI builds and runs all three on every push.

```sh
docker build -f docker/alpine.Dockerfile -t blip:alpine .
docker run --rm blip:alpine run examples/01_basics.lip
```

`docker/debian.Dockerfile` and `docker/nix.Dockerfile` build the same image
for the other two toolchains. Use `-f` with the file you want and `-t` to name
it; the three are interchangeable and differ only in the C toolchain.

> The images are built and exercised by CI but are **not** published to a
> registry. There is no `ghcr.io/metif12/blip` image, and no `docker run` from a
> remote will work until one is.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/metif12/blip.git && cd blip && v -cc gcc -o blip.exe blip.v
```

## Build and test

```sh
.\blip.exe examples\01_basics.lip

v -cc gcc -o tools\tail.exe tests\tail_calls.v     # the suite
.\tools\tail.exe

v -cc gcc -o reader_probe.exe reader_probe.v       # every example parses
.\reader_probe.exe examples\*.lip
```

## Four findings from M0

All verified on V 0.5.2 by the programs in `src/`. These are the reason the
`Value` representation looks the way it does.

1. **A boxed sum type cannot represent a pair.** `struct cons_v { tail Lst }`
   is rejected as `invalid recursive struct`. A cons cell is recursive by
   definition, so the representation V would give us for free does not work.

2. **A sum-type variant field cannot be initialised from a local.** `x := 7` then
   `cons_v{head: x}` gives `error: x evaluated but not used` — no loop or
   recursion involved. A plain non-sum struct with the same shape is fine.

3. **A `voidptr` field is not a GC root.** The original design stored payloads
   behind `o voidptr`, and it silently corrupted programs: a 2,000,000-cell cons
   chain walked **25 cells** after heap churn. `Value.payload` is therefore a
   typed `Payload` interface, which the GC does track. Same probe after the fix:
   2,000,000 / 2,000,000, sum exactly correct.

4. **A method-less marker interface holding a struct is broken.** It compiles,
   then dies with `invalid memory access` in dev and `-prod` alike. `Payload`
   carries one method for this reason.

Findings 1 and 2 are worth reporting upstream to the V project.

## Roadmap

| # | Deliverable |
|---|---|
| M0 | skeleton, `Value` representation, benchmarks — **done** |
| M1 | reader: lexer and S-expression parser, spans, collected diagnostics — **done** |
| M2 | values, printer, `equal?`, `hash` — **mostly done** |
| M3 | CEK machine — gate: 1M-call `fib`, 100k-deep `reverse`, no silent stack overflow — **tail-call gate passed** |
| M4 | special forms, core forms, ~40 primitives — **in progress** |
| M5 | macros: `defmacro`, `gensym`, quasiquote, `macex1`/`macex` |
| M6 | modules: `require`/`provide`, `only-in`, `prefix-in`, `for-syntax` |
| M7 | standard library written in blip |
| M8 | ergonomics: `match`, `match*`, `use`, pipes, labelled args, `Result`, opaque types — gate: a real 300-line program with no macros |
| M9 | tooling: REPL, span-carrying errors, formatter, `assert` as doc-tests |
| M10 | contracts and optional erased annotations |

The embedding plan, the REPL design, the example programs worth writing, and the
veb-backed final phase are in `docs/010-roadmap.md`. The ordering there differs
from this table in one respect: **errors become values before macros do.** A
panic inside an embedded interpreter unwinds through the host and kills it, so
that has to be true before anything can call blip from V, and certainly before
Lua.

Section 7 of that document is the upkeep checklist: syncing against a new V,
re-running the representation probes, and keeping the known-broken list honest.
The compiler sync is the one that matters most, because this project does not
target the `0.5.2` release — it targets vlang/v master at the commit pinned in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which resolves `vlib.blip.*` against the project's
own modules where the release build resolves it against V's standard library.

## Branches and releases

| Branch | Role |
|---|---|
| `main` | stable. Releases are cut from here by pushing a `v*` tag. Protected. |
| `dev` | integration. Pull requests land here. |
| `<topic>` | a branch off `dev` |

`main` moves only when a milestone's gate is met, so it stays something a
person can depend on. `release.yml` verifies on the tag — the same seventeen
suites a contributor runs locally — and builds the binaries and the
generated site. A
manual run of that workflow builds and verifies but does not publish, so a dry
run cannot create a release by accident.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). The short version: branch off `dev`, use
`-cc gcc`, keep all nine suites at zero `FAIL` lines, and never hand-edit the
website — it is generated by `site/build.lip` from `site/content/*.md`
through `site/layout.html`.

## The website

Generated, English-only for now, at **https://metif12.github.io/blip/**.

## Design notes worth knowing

- **The value representation was decided by the host language, not by taste.** The
  design document originally promised a three-way benchmark. Measurement turned
  out to be beside the point: two of the three candidates cannot be written at
  all on V 0.5.2.
- **`v -warn-about-allocs` and `-prealloc` arenas** are used from the start; V
  documents the latter as intended for compilers.
- **No generics.** V's own compiler skips monomorphization when building itself
  (`vlib/v/pref/pref.v:57`) for build speed; blip does the same.
- **The benchmark harness is not yet trustworthy.** It produced three wrong
  numbers before being fixed, including a 1000x unit error from coercing a
  `time.Duration` into nanoseconds. Treat its output as provisional.
